- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeMonkeyDan
- 👀 I am actively transitioning into a programming career to pursue my passion for technology and software development.
- 🌱 I am currently focused on strengthening my skills in C# and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking for opportunities to collaborate on games or other projects — anything that will help me learn and build experience.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord at CodeMonkeyDan.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Although I know there's always more to learn, I genuinely enjoy the challenges of programming and the process of continual growth.
