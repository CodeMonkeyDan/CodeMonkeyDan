- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodeMonkeyDan
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers into some sort of programming field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games or other projects. Anything I can find time to help out with that will help me learn.
- 📫 How to reach me, I am CodeMonkeyDan on Discord.
- ⚡ Fun fact: While I feel I still have a ways to go, I really enjoy the challenges of programming and learning new things.
